# Langserve Einsten Bot App

This is a Next.js app that streams Langserve streamings on the frontend. It utilizes a hook to keep the code clean and organized within components, and makes API calls to abstract away backend APIs and calls.

## Features

- Stream Langserve streamings on the frontend
- Using hooks to keep the code clean and organized within components
- Abstracted backend APIs and calls

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/langserve-nextjs.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd langserve-nextjs`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

> Of course, you should have a running Langserve backend to connect to. You can find the Langserve backend.

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Improvements
One thing that I could be improved is use a Server Action instead of fetching api.
